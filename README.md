Hey there, I'm a self-taught dev that loves back-end shit. I went from working at an amazon warehouse to making this my career. I like building apps that are performant primarily serverless. 

*   🧠  I'm learning LeetCode (working on [Grind75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75), you can see my progress in this [repository](https://github.com/NoelCov/Grind75).
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on backend projects and any programming projects related to space and gaming!

### I work with
- Java
- Spring boot
- SQL/PostgreSQL
- AWS (Mainly Lambdas, ECS, S3, EC2, API Gateway)
- I don't like front-end but know my way around HTML/CSS/JS
